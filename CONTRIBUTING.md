## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a suggestion, let us know by creating an issue:

1. Go to the Issues tab.
2. Click New Issue.
3. Provide a clear and descriptive title, along with relevant details, steps to reproduce (if applicable), and screenshots (if helpful).

## Suggesting Features

We welcome feature suggestions! To propose a feature:

1. Go to the Issues tab.
2. Create a new issue using the Feature Request template.
3. Describe the feature, its purpose, and how it could be implemented.

## Contributing Code

1. Create a Branch

    Create a new branch for your work:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```

2. Make Changes

- Add your code to the appropriate package or app within the repository.
- Follow the Code Style and Guidelines.

## Design Collaboration  

We use [Figma](https://figma.com/) to design and prototype components for the Murrieta Design System. Contributors are encouraged to review the Figma designs before proposing changes to components.  

### How to Access Figma Files

- View the **[Figma Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/your-file-id)**.  
- Request edit access by [contacting us](mailto:your-email@example.com) if you plan to contribute new designs.  

### Proposing Design Changes  

1. Duplicate the main design file into your personal drafts in Figma.  
2. Make your proposed changes.  
3. Share a link to your updated file in a GitHub issue or pull request.  

### Keep Designs and Code Aligned  

- Always test your design changes in Figma against the live components in the codebase.  
- Notify maintainers if updates in Figma need to be reflected in the code.  

## Code Style and Guidelines

- Frameworks and Tools: Murrieta uses React, Storybook, Turborepo, and Bun. Ensure compatibility and follow best practices for these tools.
- Component Structure: Follow the atomic design principles used in the project.
- Formatting: Use Prettier for consistent code formatting.
- TypeScript: Write type-safe code whenever possible.
